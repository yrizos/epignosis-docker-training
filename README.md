# Docker Basics

A set of basic exercises to complement the #EpignosisDevAcademy Docker presentation.    

## Install docker

Docker has a very typical installation process and a pretty thorough [Getting Started guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

Once you are finished with the installation, you can verify it by running: 

    $ docker run hello-world
